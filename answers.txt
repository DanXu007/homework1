Q: What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?
A: Merge lets you merge Git branches while the logs of commits on branches remain intact. Rebase lets users integrate changes from one branch to another, and the logs are modified once the action is complete. Rebase was created as a result of fixing merge conflicts.

Q: What is a remote repository?
A: Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere. You access them remotely though servers and other similar infrastructures, as they are not stored locally on your own machine.
